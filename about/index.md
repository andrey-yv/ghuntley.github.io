Hi, my name is Geoffrey Huntley, infrastructure #devopsec polyglot & software developer, co-founder of [Sydney Gamers League](/portfolio/sydney-gamers-league/) and the creator of the first [disaster/humanitarian video blog](/portfolio/waveofdestruction/) that on the day of the boxing day tsunami the world turned to for up-to-date information. I have also cycled through various countries on a unicycle.

When programming I tend to write in a asynchronous, functional reactive manner using the [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/) and [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com) but have been known to ship JavaScript (node.js) and Python. With Xamarin, applications are written entirely in [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) or [F#](https://fsharp.org), sharing the same core library code on iOS, Android &amp; Windows Phone. Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift or Java, you can do in .NET with Xamarin to create beautiful native apps.

I live in Sydney, Australia.
