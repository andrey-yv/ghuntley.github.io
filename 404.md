<h1>Could not find that page.</h1>
<p>
	Hi there, I recently migrated my blog to a new platform and may have broken a lot of links inadvertently.
</p>
<p>
	If you don't mind, please <a href="'{{ site.repo_url }}/issues/new">log an issue</a> with the URL you were trying to reach and where you found the URL. Thanks!
</p>
