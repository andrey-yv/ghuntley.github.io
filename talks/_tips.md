How to write a conference proposal by Mike Moore
http://blowmage.com/2013/01/24/writing-conf-proposals

Make the title good - convey what the session is about and what experience level it is aimed at; give them an idea of why they'd benefit from attending your session

Description/Abstract - Describing the benefits of the session is much more effective than the mechanics of what the session will cover; Sticking with the "why" is where the power of your proposal comes from; Consider the audience and make it clear why they should go to your talk

“Pay attention to what ends up in the conference sessions and figure out where you can differentiate yourself while adding value. Speak at user groups. Attend a Toastmasters meeting. Write a book. You will only get better.”

## What Your Conference Proposal Is Missing by Sarah Mei

* Imagine who will be at the conference
* Where are they from? What are they talking about?
* Imagine the decision to see your talk
* How would you convince your friends to go to your talk? Why should they be interested?
* Capture that excitement in your proposal
* Focus relentlessly on answering “Why?” Don’t hide this fundamental “Why?” question inside the description of the talk. Put it in the title and abstract, where the most people will see it. Your proposal will get more interest, more attendees, and better reviews.

Paragraph 1: The context
Talk about your audience, and how you and they have a connection - your experience is the same, they can relate to you

Paragraph 2: Well, actually … - Bring up the problem; it should be a common enough one that they can relate

Paragraph 3: The promise - Solve their problem!

## Conference Proposals that Don’t Suck by Russ Unger

Take your time - don’t expect to write your proposal in an hour

Steps:
* Write down the general, high-level ideas that you want to talk about For your eyes only - so feel free to be messy and let ideas flow
* Break your content into topic points only a very few topic points (people can only remember three things!)
* Turn your topics into a draft proposal. Really focus on wording - put your best work out there
* Ask a friend to read it over
* Revise your proposal
* Don’t be precious about it - use the feedback your friend gave you
* Submit the proposal to a conference!

## How to write a compelling proposal from We are all Awesome
http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html 

Write for the attendees rather than the talk curators 
Be specific (remember, people can only remember three things!)
Whatever question your talk answers (the “why”) ask that question outright in your proposal - it gives the audience something concrete to relate to
don’t ramble - keep your proposal short and sweet
