summary:    On the back of the packaging of the Apple USB Network Adapter thereâ€™s a little disclaimer that mentions that it can be only used with a Apple MacBook. This is not true, here's how you can get it running on Windows Vista, 7, 8.x and 10.

If you haven't already set your NPM author info, here's how you do it:

```shell
# npm set init.author.name "Your Name"
# npm set init.author.email "you@example.com"
# npm set init.author.url "http://yourblog.com"
```

If you don't have an NPM account, one can be created by running

```shell
# npm adduser
```

Next steps are to create your `package.json`:

```shell
# cd /path/to/your-project
# npm init
```

If you took on dependencies, then you should install and run pakmager.
```shell
# npm install -g pakmanager
# pakmanager deps
```

Edit your package.json and add any deps you forgot about.
```shell
# vim package.json
```

Publish your libary.

```shell
# npm publish ./ --tag beta
# npm publish ./
```
