Geoffrey has been actively involved in the Xamarin community and leading projects using this breakout technology since 2012. He is one of the maintainers of the popular ReactiveUI functional reactive programming MVVM framework.

He regularly does presentations on Xamarin technologies and has over 20 years industry experience as a T-shaped individual with deep technology, business and entrepreneurship experience. You will never see death by powerpoint on his watch - minimal, to the point, tied together with effective storytelling. He is comfortable switching between technical and non-technical styles of communication as needed to a variety of audiences.

    Geoff is a true technical innovator and is not afraid to think
    outside the box. He has found solutions to some of the toughest
    technical challenges Interactive has faced and continually asks
    "How can we do this better?"

    He views every opportunity as a challenge and does not stop 
    until the job is done.
