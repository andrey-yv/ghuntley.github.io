Imperative Programming is Dangerous

# Abstract

When we rely on hoping that the behavior that emerges from a program is correct, 
and that reliance is based on nothing more than a programmer's correctness, then
we can easily find ourselves in a sticky situation. We can try and mitigate the
costs of imperative programming with things like unit tests or integration tests,
but why mitigate the costs when there's a better way?

Instead of telling a computer how to do its job, why don't we just tell it what
it's job is and let it figure the rest out? The bottom line is imperative programming
is error-prone and relies too heavily on the infallibility of the programmer.
