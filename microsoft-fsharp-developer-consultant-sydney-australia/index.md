Geoffrey is extremely keen to hear from anyone looking to place software engineers at companies that are using the functional programming language F#. He is one of the maintainers of the popular ReactiveUI functional reactive programming MVVM framework for Xamarin/UWP/WPF written in C#. 

He regularly does presentations on open-source technologies and has over 20 years industry experience as a T-shaped individual with deep technology, business and entrepreneurship experience. You will never see death by powerpoint on his watch - minimal, to the point, tied together with effective storytelling. He is comfortable switching between technical and non-technical styles of communication as needed to a variety of audiences. 

Deep down, he dreams of lambdas but the right opporunity has not (yet) arisen. If you've got a position available send an email to <a href="mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com?Subject='F# Engagement'">ghuntley@ghuntley.com</a> for a confidential discussion. 

## Open Source

As part of constant and never ending learning, Geoff is actively engaged in contributing to the following Xamarin and .NET projects. Open-source for him is a way of life, when he's not [authoring code](https://github.com/ghuntley/) you will find him [building communities](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/687), [passing down knowledge](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/pull/771) and [mentoring first timers](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/1005).

    Geoff is a true technical innovator and is not afraid to think
    outside the box. He has found solutions to some of the toughest
    technical challenges Interactive has faced and continually asks
    "How can we do this better?"

    He views every opportunity as a challenge and does not stop 
    until the job is done.
