As part of constant and never ending learning, I'm actively engaged in contributing to the following Xamarin and .NET projects. Open-source for me is a way of life, when I'm not [authoring code](https://github.com/ghuntley/) you will find me [building communities](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/687), [passing down knowledge](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/pull/771) and [mentoring first timers](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/1005).
